				Giuseppe Sulfaro was born on October 7th 1984 in Messina, Sicily.
				He starred in Mal&egrave;na as Renato at the age of 14 having never acted before. He was among 2500 hopefuls
				who sent Guiseppe Tornatore photos as the process to cast Monica Bellucci's co-star began. Of these, 90 were
				chosen for audition, 40 made it through to the testing stage and 3 finalists had their videos sent to Miramax for approval.
				Sulfaro was catipulted into the world of the cinema, taking a year of school. While shooting took place he had to manage his
				studies around his filming schedule.<br>
				Since Mal&egrave;na Guiseppe has appeared in mainly Italian films and television shows. He also appeared in the Greek Language movie
				"A hero.......In Rome" which meant a three month crash course in learning Greek.
